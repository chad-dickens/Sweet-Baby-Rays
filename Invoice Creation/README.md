# Invoice Creation

This project is based on the same premise as my [VBA invoice creation](https://github.com/chad-dickens/Stubbs/tree/master/Invoice%20Creation) in my Stubbs repository. The main difference (aside from being in Python) is that it does not have a user interface and is designed to be run on its own. The premise is that you have a large database and you need to create a large number of invoices from this data and email them to customers.
