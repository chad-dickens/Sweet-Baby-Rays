# Share House Roster

Living with other people, it can often be helpful to create a week by week cleaning roster to allocate tasks to each house member to ensure the house stays in mint condition. This python module does just that, with a function that takes arguments for starting dates, end dates, and house mate names. The resulting output is a CSV file that you can print out and stick up in your share house lounge room.
